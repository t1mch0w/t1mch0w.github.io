Hope everything well.
Now, I'm working in a new project. However, I don't like this project. The main reason is that I think the project can be done well. I think two or three people will waste time for each. However, it's the decision of boss.

Sophia is not so good now. I hope I can help her and become her spirit support and soul mate.

Good luck to everyone!
