Happy Spring Festival!

I miss all people in my and sophia's family.
However, we don't have chance to go back home to celebrate with you all.

It's so pity.

And I keep working in these days. However, I don't have a perfect efficiency, I think I have done my best in research.

That's all. Hope sophia not angry with me. Remember, we are a team.
